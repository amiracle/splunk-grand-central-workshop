# Splunk Grand Central Workshop
Grand Central allows you to centrally manage data collection from your Cloud Data Sources. This workshop provides a hands on experience with the full functionality of Splunk and the Grand Central app. The first Cloud Data Source will focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and how to collect push friendly data sources into Splunk over HTTP Event Collector (HEC). You will be required to follow the initial steps from the Grand Central github repo.  More Cloud Data Sources will be made available as we expand the data collection capability within Grand Central. Finally, when you're done setting up the credentials and the app, you will start seeing your Cloud data in your Splunk deployment.
